* When first installing AutoLectureRecorder it fails if Microsoft Edge is not updated to the latest version
* Sometimes an AccessDenied is thrown when trying to delete the old Microsoft Edge Driver (maybe put it on temp instead?)
* When logging in and then clicking join lecture the menu where the account must be selected sometimes appears
followed by the university login page. This stops the login process
